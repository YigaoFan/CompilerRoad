** TODO Generate Cpp code to parse VBA in the future[0/3]
*** TODO Generate lex code[2/3]
   - [X] add test for lex for future maintain[0/0]
     - understand the std::forward
     - one project can export a header file, because there exists nameof(x) macro
   - [X] solve the conflict issue between TokType Terminal and RegularExpression[1/1]
     - [X] construct wrong DFA which doesn't have state result to Terminal
       - fine the Step struct
       - found: when Freeze, it has multiple result states for one step
       - Minimize<true> merge wrongly [2025-02-24 Mon]
       - fixed: in Minimize<true> worklist doesn't split accept states when specified <2025-02-25 Tue>
       - +actually is NFA2DFA issue, because one state to different states with same step+
   - [ ] support more escaped char in Terminal and RegularExpression
*** TODO Generat parse code[0/2]
   - [ ] solve operator priority issue
** TODO Generate AST code
** TODO Write Transformer code to translate VBA to Python
